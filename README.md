A car renting system created in C++

This program was developed for a school project.

The user is asked to give their name so that the program can address the user by name.
After that the user is given a list of options to choose from.

The option number 1 allows the user to list all the available car manufacturers, as well as all the models available to each manufacturer.

The option number 2 allows the user to make a reservation. They will be asked how many days they want to rent the car, and then to choose from the
list of manufacturers and models. The car chosen will then be saved to be used throughout the rest of the program.

The option number 3 will allow the user to return the car, calculating in the meantime how much it would cost based on how many days the user chose, 
as well as which model they chose.

The option number 4 will allow the user to contact the company for theft, damages etc.

The option number 5 has the option to contact the company via a list of choices(e-mail, phone etc.).

The option number 6 shows the prices of all the models, after choosing the appropriate car manufacturer.

The final option number 7 exits the program.
